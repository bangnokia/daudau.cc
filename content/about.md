# Hello, my name is Tommy Nguyen

![Tommy Nguyen](/images/me-angry.png)

I'm a developer from Vietnam and a Full Stack Overflow guy with a passion for web development.

I love creating blazingly fast and easy-to-use things.

I work with Laravel and occasionally VueJS or ReactJS, but now I've fallen in love with Svelte.

In my free time, learning other languages is my hobby. I know a little about Rust and even a little bit about Chinese xD.

You can get in touch with me via bang@daudau.cc, Github, or Twitter.

I'd like to play Dota 2 and Left 4 Dead 2.
If you like that, we can play together on Steam.
